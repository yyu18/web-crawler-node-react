# react-interview-question 
The main purpose of this excerise to test your programming skill and understanding on (1) Restful APIs, (2) HTML+CSS, (3) ReactJS or relevant frontend frameworks such as VueJS. 
This exercise consists of two sections: 
## 1. Web Crawler 
● Target Site: https://www.indeed.ca/ 

● Pick one of the following keywords for Job Title Search: Software Developer, Full Stack Developer, Web Developer or Frontend Developer 

● To build a scraper to scrape at least 500 job postings from the selected term using NodeJS; You might need to look at Cheerio; 

● Store all your scraped data into a database; You can use any databases (SQL or NoSQL); However, MongoDB is recommended; If you choose to use SQL or similar relational databases, please remember to include your migration files. 

## 2. Single Page Application for CRUD operation on Scraped Data ● Use ReactJS or relevant frontend framework to build a single page application 

that allow us to search, edit, and delete scraped data; 

● User will be able to search job postings based on keywords; 

● User will be able to edit job postings; 

● User will be able to add custom tags; 

● User will be able to soft delete scraped data; Soft Delete refers to hide the data from the User but the data still exists in the database; 

● In this task, you might need to develop at least 3 types of Restful APIs [GET for Search, Put for Update and Delete]; You will need to build these APIs using NodeJS; 

** Estimate time of the whole question should be 1 day; Please email your solution to it@savvypro.ca;
